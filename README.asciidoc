WARNING: Use this code at your own risk. Currently this is a proof of concept without any security-aspects taken care of.

Installation
------------
Download all code to your personal webserver and put it in a dedicated folder. You need php-enabled on this server

Modify the username and password in line 479 of netio.php in case you don't use admin/admin for your Net-IO device

Modify the line 68 in netio.js and point to the netio.php controller and add the dns-name or IP-address of your Net-IO device. My current default is netio01.

Usage
-----
Open the installation directory in your mobile-safari browser (only needed once). Then click on the button to add the page to your Home-Screen.
From now on you can simply open the application directly from your Main-Menu without seeing the URL-and status line of your Safari-Browser.
I'm sorry, but currently this application does not properly render within a normal browser (e.g. Firefox) on your desktop, even though I did not use
any special-events like "swipe". This might be related with the current use of CSS. Anyway it's easy to debug within FireBug and the click-events are handled properly.

ToDo
----
More than I can say....
- Get it up and running properly with a normal browser

- Make the "settings" tab not being a dummy anymore

- Include "security" features to ensure not everyone knowing the URL can control the devices (eg. password-protection)

- ...
